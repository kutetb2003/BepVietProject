Project Idea: "Bếp Việt" - A Vietnamese Cuisine & Recipe Platform
Concept: A modern, beautiful web application for users to discover, share, and review authentic Vietnamese recipes. The platform will also feature a comprehensive, searchable directory of local Vietnamese restaurants, which can be managed by their owners.

Why this is a great project:

Engaging Theme: Food is universally appealing. The project is highly visual and centered on community content, making it fun to build and use.

Real-World Complexity: It covers essential features like user-generated content, multi-role permissions (User, Manager, Admin), and content moderation.

Rich Database Schema: The relationships between users, recipes, restaurants, and reviews provide excellent complexity for a portfolio project.

Core Features
1. User-Facing Site:

Homepage: Featuring trending recipes, new restaurants, and featured cuisines.

Recipe Browsing: A gallery page with filtering (by cuisine, difficulty, etc.) and search.

Restaurant Directory: A searchable and filterable list of restaurants by city or region.

Details Pages:

Recipe Page: Ingredients, instructions, author info, and user reviews.

Restaurant Page: Address, contact info, opening hours, photos, user reviews, and a list of their "specialty" recipes.

User Contributions: Logged-in users can submit recipes and write reviews for both recipes and restaurants.

User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login.

Personalized Features: A "My Kitchen" page for users to see their submitted recipes and saved favorites.

2. Manager Panel:

Restaurant Profile Management: A dedicated dashboard for restaurant managers (ROLE_MANAGER) to update their restaurant's details (address, hours, photos).

Specialty Recipe Management: Managers can link existing recipes from the platform to their restaurant's page, highlighting them as specialties.

3. Admin Panel:

Dashboard: Overview of new content (recipes, restaurant sign-ups, reviews).

Content Management (CRUD): Full control over all recipes, cuisines, and restaurants.

Content Moderation: Approve or reject user-submitted recipes and new restaurant listings.

User Management: View and manage all users and their roles.

Database Relation Complexity (The Core Challenge)
This expanded model introduces new entities and relationships for restaurant management.

Entities:

User: Stores contributor and admin information.

id (Primary Key)

firstName, lastName, email (unique), password (hashed)

bio (A short profile description)

role (Enum: 'ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_MANAGER', 'ROLE_ADMIN')

createdAt, updatedAt (Timestamps)

Cuisine: Represents the category of a recipe.

id (Primary Key), name (unique), description, imageUrl, region (Enum)

Restaurant: A new entity for the restaurant directory.

id (Primary Key)

name, description, address, city, phoneNumber, websiteUrl

openingHours (e.g., a simple Text field)

imageUrls (List of strings)

status (Enum: 'PENDING_APPROVAL', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED')

createdAt, updatedAt

Relationship: Has a one-to-one relationship with a User who has ROLE_MANAGER.

Recipe: The core recipe entity.

id (Primary Key), title, description, instructions

prepTimeInMinutes, cookTimeInMinutes, servings, difficulty (Enum)

imageUrls (List of strings)

status (Enum: 'PENDING_APPROVAL', 'PUBLISHED', 'REJECTED')

createdAt, updatedAt

Relationships: Belongs to one User (the author), one Cuisine, and can optionally belong to one Restaurant as a specialty.

Ingredient: A master list of possible ingredients.

id (Primary Key), name (unique)

RecipeIngredient: Join table connecting a Recipe to an Ingredient.

id (Primary Key), quantity, unit

Relationships: Belongs to one Recipe and one Ingredient.

id (Primary Key), rating (1-5), comment, reviewDate

Relationships: Belongs to one User and one Recipe.

Restaurant Review: A new entity for restaurant reviews.

id (Primary Key), rating (1-5), comment, reviewDate

Relationships: Belongs to one User and one Restaurant.

Key Relationships:

User (1) <--> (1) Restaurant: A user with ROLE_MANAGER manages one Restaurant.

User (1) <--> (*) Recipe: A user can author many recipes.

User (1) <--> (*) Review / RestaurantReview: A user can write many reviews of either type.

Restaurant (1) <--> (*) Recipe: A restaurant can feature many specialty recipes.

Restaurant (1) <--> (*) RestaurantReview: A restaurant can have many reviews.

Recipe (1) <--> (*) RecipeIngredient <--> (*) Ingredient: The core many-to-many relationship for ingredients.

Step-by-Step Development Roadmap
The roadmap is extended with a new phase to handle the restaurant functionality.

Phase 1-3: (Same as before)

Phase 1: Backend Foundation: Set up the project, database, and initial entities (Recipe, Cuisine, User). Build public APIs.

Phase 2: Frontend - Recipe Display: Build the React components to display recipes.

Phase 3: User Authentication: Implement JWT-based registration and login for all user roles.

Phase 4: User Contributions (Recipes)

Frontend: Build a "Submit Recipe" form.

Backend: Create a secured endpoint for authenticated users to submit recipes (PENDING_APPROVAL status).

Frontend: Build the "My Kitchen" page.

Phase 5: Restaurant Directory

Backend: Create the Restaurant and RestaurantReview entities and repositories. Create public APIs to fetch restaurant data.

Frontend: Build a RestaurantDirectoryPage with search/filter capabilities and a RestaurantDetailPage.

Backend/Frontend: Implement the ability for users to submit reviews for restaurants.

Phase 6: Manager & Admin Panels

Backend:

Create a registration process for restaurant managers that creates a User with ROLE_MANAGER and a Restaurant with PENDING_APPROVAL status.

Create secured endpoints for managers to update their own restaurant profile.

Frontend:

Build a protected /manager section for restaurant owners.

Build a protected /admin section for admins to approve/reject new restaurants and recipes.
